# Processor-Designs
Simple RISC processor designs. </br>

1) Single Cycle Implementation of IITB RISC ISA [in Verilog]
2) Multi-cycle Implementation of custom ISA (extended version of Carpinelli's VSCPU) [in VHDL]
3) Pipelined Implementation of IITB RISC 22 ISA [in Verilog; almost ready...]

Soon to come: <br>
1) Pipelined Implementation of RISC-V (RV32I) ISA [in TL-Verilog]
2) Pipelined Implementation of IITB RISC 22 extended ISA [in Verilog]
3) Superscalar Implementation of IITB RISC 22 ISA [using some HLS]
4) Superscalar Implementation of RISC-V (RV32I) ISA [using some HLS]
