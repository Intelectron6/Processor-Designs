Extended version of Carpinelli's Very Simple CPU

ISA is custom designed. The processor is described in processor.vhdl and the instructions to be executed are given in testbench.vhdl (which writes the stuff in memory first and then executes them). </br>
Few programming examples are given in .txt files that help illustrate the usage of all supported instructions. </br>
Detailed document regarding the ISA and processor design will be uploaded soon....
